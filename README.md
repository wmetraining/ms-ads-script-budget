# ms-ads-script-budget
A Bing Ads Script for Maintaining Monthly Account Budgets

The script was origionally made by "Frederick Vallaeys" on https://www.searchenginejournal.com/bing-ads-script-monthly-account-budgets/282675/#close.

I have no idea what the licencse was for this script.

It was referencing the service myjson.com that no longer exists.

I changed it to work with https://pastebin.com/ and made a few minor changes.
